# CS215 Winter 2016, Web and Database Programming (University of Regina)
# This repository will be developed in the class along with the lectures. As we learn new technologies in the class, this repository will be updated with the code implemented in each lecture.

# Project Structure: We will follow the default project structure taught in the CS215 Lab in order to be consistent with the code organization. It is always considered as the best practice to keep the code organized by grouping the code files with the relative type or feature code files. As we develop this code (also as you will implement the advanced assignments), the overall project will keep getting complex.
